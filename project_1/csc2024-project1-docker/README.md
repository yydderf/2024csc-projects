## Install

### Build the project1 image

You need to install the docker at first,

and build the project1 image with
```bash

```

### Run the project1 containers

Run the server and client with

sudo docker compose -f csc2024-project1-docker-compose.yml up -d
```

If you encounter,
```bash
